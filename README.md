Welcome to the DRNG Library. This is a simple library aimed at bringing 
suport for the rdrand and rdseed instructions feature of Intel 
processors, starting with the 3rd Generation Intel Core(tm) processor, 
to users with toolchains that do not support these new features. For 
more information on these instructions, please visit: 

https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-digital-random-number-generator-drng-software-implementation-guide 

These instructions are an innovative hardware approach to high-quality, 
high-performance entropy and random number generation.

Because not all compiler tool chains support these new
instructions, this library was created to facilitate easy access to it.
The idea is simple: link to a pre-built static library, provided in the
lib directory, and enjoy the new feature!
